Adventure Works products each have a standard cost price that indicates the cost of manufacturing the product, and a list price that indicates the recommended selling price for the product. This data is stored in the SalesLT.Product table. Whenever a product is ordered, the actual unit price at which it was sold is also recorded in the SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail table. You must use subqueries to compare the cost and list prices for each product with the unit prices charged in each sale.
1.	Retrieve products whose list price is higher than the average unit price.
o	Retrieve the product ID, name, and list price for each product where the list price is higher than the average unit price for all products that have been sold.
 THE CODE :-
SELECT ProductID, Name,ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ListPrice > (SELECT 
                       AVG (UnitPrice)
                    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail
                    )
 ORDER BY ProductID ASC

Retrieve Products with a list price of 100 or more that have been sold for less than 100.
o	Retrieve the product ID, name, and list price for each product where the list price is 100 or more, and the product has been sold for less than 100.
THE CODE :-
SELECT ProductID, Name,ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductID IN  (SELECT ProductID FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail WHERE 
        UnitPrice < 100) AND ListPrice>= 100
        ORDER BY ProductID ASC

The standard cost of a product and the unit price at which it is sold determine its profitability. You must use correlated subqueries to compare the cost and average selling price for each product.
1.	Retrieve the cost, list price, and average selling price for each product
o	Retrieve the product ID, name, cost, and list price for each product along with the average unit price for which that product has been sold.
THE CODE:-
SELECT P.ProductID, P.Name,P.StandardCost, P.ListPrice ,
   (SELECT  AVG(OD.UnitPrice) 
    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS OD 
    WHERE P.ProductID = OD.ProductID ) AS Average_unitePrice
FROM SalesLT.Product AS P 
ORDER BY P.ProductID ASC 


1.	Retrieve products that have an average selling price that is lower than the cost.
o	Filter your previous query to include only products where the cost price is higher than the average selling price.
THE CODE:-
SELECT P.ProductID, P.Name,P.StandardCost, P.ListPrice ,
     (SELECT  AVG(OD.UnitPrice) 
      FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS OD WHERE P.ProductID = OD.ProductID ) 
      AS Average_unitePrice
FROM SalesLT.Product AS P
WHERE P.StandardCost > 
     (SELECT  AVG(O.UnitPrice) 
      FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS O 
      WHERE P.ProductID = O.ProductID )
ORDER BY P.ProductID ASC
